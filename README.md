# MSC_Adams_Projects
The previous Pictures are screenshots from my MSC Adams miscellaneous projects done in 2022.


I acquired some skills through dealing with these adams projects:
- Design real life application with adams view
- Insert parts and connectors between then
- Apply forces and motions on the model
- Measure the position (x, y , and z), velocity, angular verlocity (x, y, and z), acceleration, force (x, y, and z) and torque (x, y, and z) wether due to gravity or not
- Import SW (SolidWorks) model -part/assembly- into MSC_Adams
